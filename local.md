# Run cmpct.io locally
It is pretty easy to get cmpct.io running, please get in touch if you have any trouble.

## Pre-requisites
- You need a few things on your machine to work with cmpct.io
1. **Git** - To clone and work with branches
2. **Fork of this repo** - So you can submit PR's
3. **NodeJS** - Version 8, 10 and 12 have all be found to work
4. **NPM** - To install packages and run the website
5. **IDE** - We recommend VSCode

## Run the website
- With the code open in your IDE, open a terminal and run the following commands
1. `npm install` - To install the dependencies
2. `npm run dev` - To start the website
3. Now you can visit the website, probably hosted at localhost:3000

## Notes
- When you run the website locally you will not be hooked up to the API
- We are looking to deploy a development instance of the API which your local machine can use
