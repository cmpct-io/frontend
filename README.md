### What is cmpct.io?
Essentially cmpct.io is a link shortener, like bit.ly, but it has some features that distinguish it, such as...
 - **A landing page**: when using a shortened link the user is not directed to the target website straight away, they land on cmpct.io so they can see where the link will take them.
	 - This is important because it means people can avoid being sent to unsafe websites, but can still benefit from using a shorter link.
 - **Ability to add comments** to shortened links, telling other people what they think about a link, this could even be used to collect feedback from people about a website.
 - **Ability to report unsafe links**, scammers often use shorter links because they hide where the user will actually go, but because the landing page shows you where you will go, you can report it as unsafe to flag it up to other users. This makes cmpct.io links much more trustworthy.

### Other benefits
