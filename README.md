### Why use cmpct.io?
There are lots of link shorteners out there, but none like cmpct.io. We differ in a few ways...

1.  **Landing Page**: Our competitors provide short links, but they hide where you will go. we don't automatically redirect you, but present you with a landing page where you can see the destination links before you choose to go there.
2. **Link Groups**: Because we have a landing page, you can actually create one short link that links to multiple places, why not create a list of gift items?
3. **Screenshots**: We capture a screenshot of every link automatically on our servers, so you can see what the page looks like before you visit
4.  **Comments**: Add comments to a link to provide feedback to its creator.
5.  **Reports**: Report links which are unsafe to protect yourself and others, scammers don't use cmpct.io because they are so easy to stop.
6.  **Privacy**: We don't want to harvest your information, so we don't have an account system, you don't need to sign in or give any of your data away. We gather the minimum amount of analytics information to ensure we deliver a robust service.
7.  **Free**: We don't make any revenue from cmpct.io, that means no premium plans or paid addons. No advertising and we don't sell data that we collect either, it is run simply to deliver a really useful website to those who want it.
