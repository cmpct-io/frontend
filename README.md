### What is cmpct.io?
You may have heard of projects like bit.ly where you paste a long URL and the service spits back a shorter one you can share with friends and colleagues. cmpct.io is a bit like bit.ly but it differs in a few ways...
1. **No automatic redirect**: bit.ly provides really short links, but they obfuscate where you will actually end up, this isn't great; so cmpct.io doesn't automatically redirect you, but you go to a landing page where you can see the destination before you choose to go there.
2. **Comments**: I frequently work on projects and ask others for feedback, but its never easy to collect it; so I wanted to make it possible for people to leave comments on one of the links generated.
3. **Reports**: Scammers often use bit.ly because they can get unsuspecting users to go to unsafe websites, so cmpct.io has a reporting capability which alerts you if the link you have been provided is unsafe; before you go there!
4. **Privacy focused**: Internet companies love to harvest your info and habits, so I wanted to build one that stored absolutely nothing about you. Hence the project doesn't even have an account system, nor do we store on our servers a list of the links you have visited.
5. **Free**: I build software because I enjoy building software, I have a job to make money, so a key advantage cmpct.io can offer is that I have no intention of generating revenue from it.
